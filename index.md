## Snowboarding

I started my first season 2011/12 in Muju Resort which is called Deogyusan Ski Resort now.

Every season, I got season pass in High1 Resort, Yangji Pine Resort, Daemyung Resort, or Jisan Forest Resort.

I prefer riding but not trick and jibbing at all.

## Tekkken series

I developed macro joystick for Tekken series and released the electric circuit and parts list as well as source code for micro controller(you can see this on my blog).

I was a Kuma/Panda player during Tekken 5 - 7, and ranked Usurper for Tekken 7 in Steam.

## Hearthstone

I loved to play games from Blizzard except the World of Warcraft but I don't play any game recently.

## Walker

I achieved ranked first in the world this mobile game named 'Walker' last year.

It had been around 3 years and I played every day at once(even I was abroad).

Thanks for all members in "Walker Korea".
